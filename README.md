Adds a vertical value for horizontal fade. Very useful because clipping planes on projectors are often broken.
TO USE: open the unity projector.shader file in a code editor and replace the code (or swap the file). 
Use the ToggleProjectorFadeVertical to enable or disable the fade on a projector component, make sure to add to the same object as a projector or the toggle will not work.
